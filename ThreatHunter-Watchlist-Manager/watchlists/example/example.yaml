description: "An attacker can bypass AMSI and/or previously patched AMSI vulnerabilities by dropping their own DLL and invoking an AMSI eligible process.
              This query looks for amsi.dll being loaded from a non-standard windows path which is a high confidence indicator that AMSI dll search 
              order hijacking is taking place."
false positives: 'One endpoint security vendor is using the same name of their amsi dll as the built in system library name. This goes against development best practices.'
